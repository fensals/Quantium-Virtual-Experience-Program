# Quantium-Virtual-Internship

This repository contains all files used and scripts created for the tasks i performed during my virtual internship program

These tasks work through a common narrative, designed to replicate life in the Retail Analytics and Strategy team at Quantium.

Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics  was performed using Python. 
  
  Insights from Task 1:
  
    Budget-Older families, Mainstream-Young Singles/Couples, and Mainstream Retirees contribute the most to Total sales.

    There are more Mainstream-Young Singles/Couples and Mainstream-Retirees customers, which explains their huge contribution to  Total sales.

    Although there arent many Budget-Older families, their high frequency of purchase is the reason why they contribute more to Total Sales.

    175g pack sized chips are the most purchased.

    Mainstream-Young Singles/Couples aren't really deterred by high prices and seem more interested in 270g pack sizes and Tyrells chips
